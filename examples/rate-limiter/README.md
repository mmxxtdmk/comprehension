# Rate Limiter Example

Side-by-side comparison of traditional mnemonic programming vs. Natural Language Programming.

## Traditional Implementation
See `traditional.py` — low-level code with shallow context (comments often ignored).

## Natural Language Programming
See `nl_prompt.md` — Paste this full comprehension prompt into an LLM to generate code, tests, and docs. Iterate by adding more context.

This demonstrates how NL front-loads domain knowledge, trade-offs, and intent for faster, robust results.
