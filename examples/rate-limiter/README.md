**Hands-on practice arena for Natural Language Programming**

Side-by-side comparisons that show the real difference between traditional (mnemonic/low-level) programming and rich Natural Language Programming.

### Current examples
- **rate-limiter/** — Healthcare SaaS rate limiter (GDPR, privacy-first, 10k RPS, fail-safe)

### How to extract maximum value
1. Open the **[Interactive Scratchpad](../comprehension.ipynb)**
2. Duplicate the Rate Limiter section
3. Try the traditional version yourself
4. Paste the rich NL prompt into your LLM
5. Compare speed, quality, and robustness

Add your own domain examples (finance, embedded, ML, etc.). The deeper the contrast, the more the community learns.
