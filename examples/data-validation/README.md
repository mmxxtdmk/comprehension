# Data Validation Example

Side-by-side comparison — traditional shallow context vs. Natural Language Programming.

## Traditional Implementation
See `traditional.py` — Pydantic validator with library-centric code and ignored comments (intent stays external).

## Natural Language Programming
See `nl_prompt.md` — Full mental model (domain, GDPR, audit, threat model, failure modes) passed as first-class input.

Copy the NL prompt into any frontier LLM and watch it generate production-grade code + tests + compliance docs in one shot.

Try it in the **[Interactive Scratchpad](../comprehension.ipynb)**.
