# 01 — Core Thesis: Natural Language Programming

**It’s not vibe coding. It never was.**

Traditional programming languages were designed so that *context* is mechanically trivial (mnemonics, variables, types, control flow).

The model operationalizes it.

Result: faster velocity + higher robustness.
