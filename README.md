# comprehension

**“It’s not vibe coding. It never was. It’s Natural Language Programming.”**

**Natural Language Programming adds comprehension to context — something that has always been trivial (and deliberately shallow) in traditional computer programming.**

An open-source contribution that treats rich human comprehension as a first-class input to software creation.

| Level              | What you get                              | Where to go                          |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 30 seconds         | Core thesis + quick overview              | This README                          |
| 10 minutes         | Interactive scratchpad & live examples    | [comprehension.ipynb](comprehension.ipynb) |
| 1 hour+            | Hands-on practice & reusable templates    | `/examples`, `/patterns`             |
| Ongoing / Mastery  | Deep essays, agent experiments, community | `/essays`, `/advanced`, Issues       |
