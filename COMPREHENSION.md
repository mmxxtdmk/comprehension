# Contributing to comprehension

Thank you for exploring Natural Language Programming.

The goal of this repo is progressive value: the more you comprehend and use it, the more value you extract — and the more you can give back.

### How to Contribute (in order of depth)

1. **Use the notebook** — fork, add your own cells, try new prompts.
2. **Add to `/examples`** — new domain-specific side-by-side (traditional vs NL).
3. **Improve `/patterns`** — new reusable comprehension templates.
4. **Write in `/essays`** — deeper analysis or counter-arguments.
5. **Extend `/advanced`** — comprehension agents, tools, research.

**All work is public only.** Open an Issue first to discuss, then submit a PR.  
Personal boundaries are respected at all times.

This is a contribution to the craft of programming — nothing more.
