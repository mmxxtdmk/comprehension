**The next frontier: Persistent Comprehension Agents & Research**

Experiments that turn Natural Language Programming into stateful, accumulating intelligence.

### What lives here
- Agent starter notebooks
- Memory / knowledge-graph implementations
- Multi-agent designs
- Research notes and future extensions

### Get started
Open **`01-comprehension-agent-starter.ipynb`**  
Run the cells → start feeding it your own mental models.

The more you train the agent, the more valuable it becomes — exactly like this repository.

**Contribution invitation**  
Build something cool here? Open a PR — it becomes community property.
